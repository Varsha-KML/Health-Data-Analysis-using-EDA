# Health-Data-Analysis-using-EDA
Objective:

Explore, analyze, and compare body measurement data (such as weight, height, and circumferences) and derived health indicators (like BMI and waist-to-hip/height ratios) between adult male and female participants from the NHANES dataset.




Works and Results:


1.Confirmed that male participants, on average, weigh more than female participants in this dataset.

2.Visualized the spread and central tendency of male and female weights using histograms and box plots:

      Showed both male and female weights are somewhat right-skewed. Males generally have higher peak weights.

      Boxplots clearly showed a higher median weight for males. Compared the spread of the middle 50% of weights (the box) and highlighted potential extreme weight values          (outliers).

3.Demonstrated how BMI relates strongly to waist and hip circumferences in females.

4.Showcased how standardizing data helps in comparing different body measurements.

5.Identified that individuals with very high or low BMI have correspondingly high or low standardized measurements in other areas like waist and hip:
      
      Indicates a strong positive correlation between BMI and these other body measurements in the standardized dataset.
