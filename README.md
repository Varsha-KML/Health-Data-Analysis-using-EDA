# Health-Data-Analysis-using-EDA
Objective:
Explore, analyze, and compare body measurement data (such as weight, height, and circumferences) and derived health indicators (like BMI and waist-to-hip/height ratios) between adult male and female participants from the NHANES dataset.




Works and Results:
Confirmed that male participants, on average, weigh more than female participants in this dataset.
Visualized the spread and central tendency of male and female weights using histograms and box plots.
Demonstrated how BMI relates strongly to waist and hip circumferences in females.
Showcased how standardizing data helps in comparing different body measurements.
Identified that individuals with very high or low BMI have correspondingly high or low standardized measurements in other areas like waist and hip circumference.
